# hello-world
Just another hello, world!

Making some changes...
Telling you somethings about me:
I'm a chemist-teacher-programmer-writer. Not a mess, just multi-task... =D
Started programming in BASIC, then VB and C# were the logical way. A little PASCAL and Delphi too, long time ago.
HTML, JavaScript, CSS and so many other cool stuffs!
